I **LOVE** learning. In an effort to become a better student, I have fully conditioned myself to romanticize the act of absorbing information
and diving headfirst into rabbit holes. 

I wholeheartedly believe that falling in love with learning will not only make studying much more enjoyable, but will develop a sense of curiosity
that will take you much farther than just learning for the sake of getting a good grade in a class.

Just imagine how much untapped knowledge there is in libraries, waiting to be learned. 

Here's an exercise. Just pretend that what you're reading is the coolest thing ever. Fully gaslight yourself into enjoying what you're learning.
Give 120% into reading that supposedly lame math textbook. *Multivariable Calculus and its Applications*. Nah, math lore. Isn't that so cool?

### Learning with Context
I especially love it when I understand the context of what I'm learning. For example, I taught myself web development over the summer.

Jumping straight into coding a website got dull. Fast. I started with frameworks and libraries like React without first understanding the foundations underneath them.

I took a step back and admitted that I had no idea what was going on. I purposefully limited myself to plain old Javascript and HTML/CSS. 
Understanding the pain points first-hand created a newfound love and appreciation for modern tools.

I love reading the history and the decisions of why things are designed the way they are. It gets me hyped to see how far we've come. This article is so good and is a great read.

### Conclusion
Just remember that anything worth learning will be hard to learn! Keep at it!
